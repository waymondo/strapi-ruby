# Strapi

[Strapi](https://strapi.io) is an Open source Node.js Headless CMS to easily build customizable
APIs. It’s great for quickly building your data layer alongside a UI to manage it.

Say you (like me) like to quickly build sites and applications in Ruby and/or/on Rails. The goal of
the Strapi gem is to make it just as easy to define Ruby classes that represent and interact with
your Strapi content types as it is to define them within Strapi itself.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'strapi'
```

Or if you want to run the absolute latest, potentially unreleased version:

``` ruby
gem 'strapi', github: 'waymondo/strapi-ruby'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

## Usage

Note: this gem has only been tested with Strapi v4. It may work with previous versions of Strapi, but they
remain untested at this time.

### Configuration

You will first need to set an `ENV` variable for `STRAPI_HOST_URL`, `STRAPI_IDENTIFIER` and
`STRAPI_PASSWORD`. This can be done with [`dotenv`](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/), in an
initializer, or some other mechanism.

If using `dotev`, your `.env` file would contain:

```
STRAPI_HOST_URL=http://localhost:1337
STRAPI_IDENTIFIER=admin@example.com
STRAPI_PASSWORD=password
```

The `STRAPI_IDENTIFIER` and `STRAPI_PASSWORD` should be the login information for a user with a role
that grants access to your authenticated content. [Strapi Authenticated request
documentation](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/guides/auth-request.html)

Upon running the first method that interacts with the Strapi API, a JWT token will be fetched and
cached.

### Defining Content Type Classes

In Ruby, define some content type classes, i.e.:

``` ruby
class Farm < Strapi::ContentType
  field :name
  field :cows, content_type: 'Cow'
  field :photo, content_type: 'Strapi::Media'
end
```

``` ruby
class Cow < Strapi::ContentType
  field :name
  field :farm, content_type: 'Farm'
end
```

Using the `field` class method will define getter and setter methods for the class objects. If you
supply a class name to the `content_type` option, it will transform it to an instance of that class
when using the getter method. This works for both one-to-one and one-to-many relations:

``` ruby
cow.name # => "Hershey"
cow.farm # => #<Farm>
farm.name # => "McDonald’s"
farm.cows # => [#<Cow>, #<Cow>]
```

In keeping with ruby conventions, attribute keys returned from your Strapi API will be underscored,
so if you have an attribute of `"colorPattern": "jersey"` in your JSON, your field definition should
be `field :color_pattern`.

[`Strapi::Media`](https://github.com/waymondo/strapi-ruby/blob/main/lib/strapi/media.rb) is an
included content type class to represent photos, videos, and files. Feel free to extend this class
if you would like to add additional functionality or granularity.

``` ruby
farm.photo # => #<Strapi::Media>
farm.photo.url # => "http://localhost:1337/uploads/farm-1.jpg"
```

By default, `Strapi::ContentType` will infer it’s API plural id from the demodulized, dasherized,
pluralized name of the ruby class. For example, it would assume a class of `FarmWorker` would have a
Strapi plural ID of `farm-workers`. If you would like to customize this, you can set it in the class
definition:

``` ruby
class FarmWorker
  plural_id 'farmers'
end
```

Strapi default timestamps fields (`created_at`, `updated_at`, `published_at`) are automatically converted
into `DateTime` objects and do not need to be added with `field` declarations.

### Fetching Entries

`Strapi::ContentType` provides some predictable methods for retrieving entries from your Strapi API:

``` ruby
Cow.all # => [#<Cow>, #<Cow>, #<Cow>]
cow = Cow.find(1)
cow.id # => 1
```

Both `.all` and `.find` accept a hash of options that map to Strapi’s allowed [API
parameters](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/database-apis-reference/rest-api.html). No
parameter options are included by default, so if you want to eagerly load related content types for
example, you’ll need to specify that with the `populate` option:

``` ruby
cows = Cow.all(populate: '*')
cows.first.farm.name # => "McDonald’s"
farm = Farm.find(1, populate: ['cows'])
farm.cows.first.name # => "Hershey"
```

The class method `.where` also exists, which is the same implementation as `.all`, except a hash of
API parameters is required.

``` ruby
cows = Cow.where(filters: { name: { '$eq': 'Hershey' } })
```

### Pagination
In order to paginate results, you can have to provide the Strapi's [API pagination parameters](https://docs.strapi.io/dev-docs/api/rest/sort-pagination#pagination), it will return an
`Strapi::CollectionContentType` object with the following convenience methods:

```ruby
farms = Farm.all(pagination: { page: 1, pageSize: 10 })

# Collection's methods
farms.size # => 10 # or count
farms.has_next_page? # => true
farms.first # => #<Farm>

# Pagination's methods
farms.pagination.page # => 1
farms.pagination.page_size # => 10
farms.pagination.page_count # => 5
farms.pagination.total # => 45
```

### Creating, Updating, Deleting

You can create and update entries by calling `.save` on them:

``` ruby
cow = Cow.new(name: 'Hershey')
cow.id # => nil
cow.save # => performs POST request
cow.id # => 1
cow = Cow.find(1)
cow.name = 'Bessie'
cow.save # => performs PUT request
```

You can also use `create` class method to more concisely create entries:

``` ruby
cow = Cow.create(name: 'Bessie')
cow.id # => 1
```

You can delete entries by calling `.delete` on them:

``` ruby
cow = Cow.find(1)
cow.delete # => performs DELETE request
cow = Cow.find(1) # => raises Strapi::Error
```

### Error Handling

Any non successful Strapi request will raise a
[Strapi::Error](https://github.com/waymondo/strapi-ruby/blob/main/lib/strapi/error.rb) with the API
response’s status, message, and payload, which you can rescue and handle accordingly:

``` ruby
def show
  cow = Cow.find(123)
  render :cow, cow: cow
rescue Strapi::Error => e
  render :error, message: e.message
end
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run
the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to
experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new
version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which
will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem`
file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
